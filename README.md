## README

I have started the iTunes U course on developing iOS 7 apps called CS193P. I am
going to use this repository for notes and such from that class. If you are also
taking this course feel free to reach out to me and we can study and help each 
other. 

## Update

I might have to take a brake since this is getting tough. I am going to look into
some standard objective-c classes and then come back.
